Users input section information such as the associated course code, type, start and end times, and day using the graphical user interface. The course code is an alphanumerical code that specifies what course the lecture or tutorial section is for. The start time of the section typically ranges from 9:00am to 9:00pm while the the finish time of the section should be between the start time to 9:00pm. The currently supported section types are lectures and tutorials/practicals.
